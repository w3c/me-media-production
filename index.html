        This document collects use cases and requirements for improved support
        for building web applications that allow end-users to manipulate
        professional media assets, including audio-visual masters for television
        and motion pictures, and perform media production steps such as quality
        checking, versioning, or timed text authoring.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Professional media assets, including audio-visual masters for television
        and motion pictures, are increasingly being stored in the cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a corresponding growing interest in building web applications
        that allow end-users to manipulate these assets, e.g., quality checking,
        versioning, timed text authoring, etc. While the web platform has
        evolved to support consumer media applications, professional
        applications require additional capabilities, including precise timing,
        wider color gamut and high-dynamic range, high-fidelity timed text, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document analyses gaps in web platform technologies for media
        production through use cases and requirements.

        <h3>Frame identification</h3>
        <p>
          Web applications measure time values with respect to a
          <a>monotonic clock</a> [[HR-TIME]]. The [[[HTML]]] [[HTML]] does not
          expose any precise mechanism to assess the time value, with respect to
          that clock, at which a particular media frame is going to be rendered.
          A web application may only infer this information by looking at the
          <a data-cite="HTML#media-element">media element</a>'s
          {{HTMLMediaElement/currentTime}} property to infer the frame being
          rendered and the time at which the user will see the next frame.
          This has several limitations:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            {{HTMLMediaElement/currentTime}} is represented as a double value,
            which does not allow it to identify individual frames due to
            rounding errors. This is a
            <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/609">known issue</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            {{HTMLMediaElement/currentTime}} is updated at a user-agent defined
            rate (typically the rate at which the
            <a data-cite="HTML#time-marches-on">time marches on</a> algorithm
            runs), and is kept stable while scripts are running. When a web
            application reads {{HTMLMediaElement/currentTime}}, it cannot tell
            when this property was last updated, and thus cannot reliably assess
            whether this property still represents the frame currently being
            rendered.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In addition, {{HTMLMediaElement/currentTime}} only accepts a time
          value, and neither has the ability, nor is there an alternative API,
          to set its value to a frame number or SMPTE time code [[SMPTE12-1]].
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Seeking to next/previous frame</h3>
        <p>
          The <a data-cite="HTML#media-element">media element</a> does not
          provide a mechanism to seek by individual frames. This can be worked
          around by using the media's frame rate and the
          <a data-cite="HTML#media-element">media element</a>'s
          {{HTMLMediaElement/currentTime}} property to seek by a frame duration
          from the reported {{HTMLMediaElement/currentTime}} value, but the
          {{HTMLMediaElement/currentTime}} property does not guarantee frame
          level precision. In addition, the frame rate of the media may vary
          over time, may be rounded internally by the browser, and is not
          exposed.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Indeterminate frame boundaries for segments in Media Source Extensions
        </h3>
        <p>
          When appending segments using [[[MSE]]] [[MSE]], the
          <a data-cite="MSE#dom-sourcebuffer-timestampoffset"><code>
          timestampOffset</code></a> property does not provide enough precision
          to identify frame boundaries. This suffers the same limitation as
          {{HTMLMediaElement/currentTime}}, where the value is represented as a
          double, which does not allow it to identify individual frames due to
          rounding errors.
        </p>

        <h3>Synchronization with remote playback</h3>
        <p>
          For playback of remote content (e.g., via the [[[REMOTE-PLAYBACK]]]
          [[REMOTE-PLAYBACK]] or [[[PICTURE-IN-PICTURE]]]
          [[PICTURE-IN-PICTURE]]), whether the content will be able to be
          synchronized remains an open question. This
          <a href="https://github.com/w3c/media-and-entertainment/issues/21">has
          been reported</a> by the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webscreens/">Second Screen
          Community Group</a>.
